Great functions together with great documentaiton.
I found many syntax mistakes on one of the five functions. 
Great functions where the documentations provide insight
 I like these two functions. The documentation of these two functions can be better.
Great start. I like to see how it will all package altogether.
Great functions and great documentation. I did not see the statistical implementation of these functions
I recommend redoing these functions. I see problems
Great functions with great documentation. I like it
I like the simplicity of the work. Four solid functions with great data set that support those functions. 
Great function and documentation. Lack of statistical support to those functions. The code is clean. Well done.
Great functions and great display the statistical implementation of these functions
I like the functions and documentations. I see great potential for the implementation of the statistics.
These functions need some updating. I see this work as very promising.

Great functions. I did not see the implementation of the statistics.
 I like the documentation you provide and clear description to each function.  
I found few errors in your code and function formation. 
Great functions that are well documention.
 Great functions and great documentations. I would recommend you to also provide vignettes
"Great functions. I like the third function, it is more complex and provides more insights. It is very promising work. "
"Overall, great job."
It would be interesting if the third function will also provide dependence to support. That will be a great addition.
"Excellent functions, documentation, and statistical foundations."

Well done with great documentation.
I do not understand the functions you presented. I would recommend better documentation
I am not sure about the functions you created. I find syntax problems
Great functions that can be easily applied to statistical analysis. Well done.
I like it
This is not good work. The functions do not look real. They are made up.
Luck of documentation.
Better documentation is necessary to make this work stand up.


This package display on Github looks great. I also enjoy your comments you added and your sense of humor. Way to go.
This is a simplistic yet efficient package. 
This reviewer finds this project well earn full credit for their work. Well Done. I like your complied code you use and apply it to R.
This work is great. The project is  notmissing any files and has all the documentation. I recommend high grade for this work
"I enjoy reviewing this work. I learned what I was missing from my work. Just one note, your filter functions can be more precise. "
Great work. 
I find this package is well designed and with great work follow. Great use of dplyr function 
Errors in the code. I found errors in calling your functions. Did you conduct debug on your code before releasing it? 
Lack of consistency. This package has some errors and a lack of documentation to support the functions. 
"I find overall, great work but I found few issues with the functions of the package. Those issues are mostly syntax errors and not matching patterns in the strings."
"This work is not interesting. I did not find any unique features in this work. As a result, I recommend redoing this project."
This is great project with great functions. Well done
An excellent project that provides access to all the R package resources. 
"Simple project. Just one note, you can modify your factor order and leavels. You need to add it to your documentation."
Excellencet work
This is bad. I saw only four files and they are not R files.
This is unacceptable work.
I do not understand this work. I think the creator just push files to the GitHub without consolidate thise files.
Great project. I enjoy reviewing this project. I learned about the model you built into R and your excellent documentation.
An excellent project. Your package communicate clearly the model you built and all the R package resources support this model.
Great project
Nice work
Great
I like it
This is unfinished work
Waste my time
Why do I need to see it
Great
This is well design R package and project. The project had great workflow together with clear code sytle that is easy to flow. The package also had metadata in the form of dependenices and great license. Well done
I like it
Why do we need to this? The work looks great but I do not understand the benefit of reviewing other people's work.
"This reviewer finds this project great, it provides all the elements necessary  "
I reviewed this work and I find it great. The project not only had all the necessary elements put together but also presents a testing file. I like it
"I like this work, it has great functions with great documentation."
Yes 
Nice work but it needs to provide more explanation as to why the syntax of the function so strange.
"This project needs more work. Lack of documentation, the GitHub posting missing files and r code is incomplete. "
Overall impression 2.5 out of 5. Why? I did not find any unique or creative functions. The documentation was OK but not great and Markdown file has error.  
This is a simple but smart package. Both for its unique functions and documentation
This project was well done and thought out.  The topic of this package is unique and I enjoyed reading the documentations about this old statstical formula this package created for. functions in their code to show the color palettes that can be used based off of the movies. I think they maybe could have benefited from a library or two but overall the code worked well without it.
Outstanding R project. I like it
I dislike it even though it holds all the necessary files and documentation. The problem with this work starts with the organization of the functions and loading code. This package does not take those aspects into account. I tried to install it but failed.
"This package has a good idea, but it does not have the necessary documentation to explain to the user how to actually use it"
"Overall, great project. The functions are good, however it needs better documentation."
"I like this work, it is very creative. The issue, lack of documentaiton"
"Outstanding R project. It has great functions, great documentation and very smart use of S3 and S4.  "
"The functions here were complex, unique, and inter-related effectively. Well done"
"Unable to find any functions/description of package, or the actual name of the package to install it"
" I think this was good work. I can see that you put a lot of effort into creating this package. I couldn't really help you with your error you reported. Usually, when running check it is more detailed at what went wrong. "
"This project had a great idea going in, it is a shame that it did not come together as a proper package"
I am not sure about this work. I am not fully understand it.
"Overall, this package idea was well thought out and is useful when wanting to know the intersection of 2 3D vectors. "
This is outstanding project. I was able to install the package from GitHub but I run into problems running the seven funnctions this package created. The problem might be that those functions are not part of the data.frame this project presented. I would recommend to revise the data.frame.
" There are 7 functions, and each function does not realted to any other. Each function is documented in the support document.  "
"I like this work, it has great functions with great documentation."
"That is a great project. Great idea, great functions, and most importantly, great data"
"I find this project unique functions, this is the first time I see the debugging test file as part of its report. Well done"
"I like this package, it has all the elements that we were asked to provide. That includes functions, data, documentation, and others."
I do not understand this work. Yes it have all the elements exist but it does not make any sense to put them all together.
Overall impresson: 5. Outstanding work
"Neat, clear and easy to understand package."
"The functions are unique, and inter-related effectively. The documetation of the package is the missing link."
Fun project. I like it.
Great project


"This work has very unique functions, documentation of those function. I think this work is ready to be published"
Very creative functions. 
This is great project with great functions. This project also provided blog posting.
Great functions and great documentations.
Great code that forms these functions.
" The help document help to understand the functions, great job"
The code style of the functions was very clear and so was the documents for those functions. Well done. .
There are 5 functions and each function is documented with an illustration
"I found that 4 out of 5 functions have errors and syntax errors. So, something is wrong here."
The functions this work presents are well written - code-wise and documented properly. 
"I reviewed the functions and documention. I find that the functions have syntax errors. For example, the if condition is not fully stated. "
The functions created in this assignment are an adaption from Wickham ggplot2 functions. Is this allowed? 
The documentation of these functions make a lot of sense
The functions and documentation provide great insight into this work.  Well done. 
Great
 Great functions and great coverge of the functions in the documention
I do not understand what I am looking at.
This is not good assignment. 
Well design functions and documentations
The functions are well written. 
The functions works and documention support them
Simple functions. I like it it
The functions are documented with great details
"I disagree with the reviewers, I tested the functions that they have syntax errors."
"The functions are complex, and documentations offer easy means of understanding the structure of this project. "
Simple functions 
Clear functions and documention
Sharp functions and documentation
The functions in this assignment are not well documentated. I was not able to test them without real data.
Great functions 
I feel that the functions presented in this assignment are too complex and documentation does not do a good job explaining them.  
None of the functions presented in this assignment works
Great functions with great documentation
Perfect
Well done
Great job.
Great
Great functions and documentations
The functions are not clear and not well written. They have many flaws. 
Missing a good description to those unique functions
The functions are not well documented
The functions are unique but lack documentation.
Great functions and documentations
Very creative functions and your perfect code for execution. Well done
Great functions
 The functions and documentation are visible but I found few errors.
"Great functions, very unque. The singel documentation lists all the functions. "
This is not complete work. Some of the functions do not have documentation.
Outstanding functions and they are very creative. 
Great functions and documentations
"Project seems a bit unfocused. I don't really see the point of having a library of emojis. The graph does not provide any type of statistical relevance. The project clearly shows a knowledge base of how to use R on a technical level, but not a fundamental level."
I am impressed with the functions you created and documentation you provided. 
I really like your functions with great documentation. 
Excellent documentation and very creative functions. 
Your functions and documentation of your project are very clean and easy to follow.
Great functions
Well done with great documentation.
Not unique functions. I saw similar functions on GitHub
great job
 Perfect functions
I see only one function with no documentation
One function with four syntax errors
Why?
Great job. 
Outstanding assignment
Perfect assignment
This is not good work.

"This work has all the elements required to have and that includes; unique functions, documentation of those functions, debug file, data source file, and additional resources."
This is very smart idea and the project code and documntation support this idea. 
This is great project with great functions. This project also provided blog posting.
This is an interesting topic. The code is very organized but i don't see where you print the graphs in the code. Maybe I missed that part. Very creative and easy to read code overall
"Great code, but I found it hard to follow workflow and code style. Overall great work!"
This is a very well organized project. The code is easy to follow and is written in an efficient manner. The help document help and written in clear maner.
"Very well done! The code was nice to read, the documentation were also well organized and good comments so anyone can follow. Interesting topic too!"
"Well done. There are 5 functions, and when I tested each of these functions, it produced a different error. Second, the help documentation does not provide documentation for support. "
"Overall impression: 3 out 5. The main reason, lack of testing this R package. I also was unable to install this package. The issue I find, many of the functions I reviewed has errors. "
This is an interesting topic. The code is very organized but i don't find consistency regarding the work flow and code syle. One function is based on top leavel and other does not.  Maybe I missed that part. 
"In this project, no I did not find any single library.  The functions files do not have supporting documents to explain them. This work needs to redo"
"The overall the quality of this package was well done and thought out, this was a unique topic that I enjoyed reading about and they used enough. functions in their code to show the color palettes that can be used based off of the movies. I think they maybe could have benefited from a library or two but overall the code worked well without it."
"Overall, intersting. These functions rely on user input, and therefore can work with any data. I could add a matrix or array of data if neccesary, though! The documentation of these functions make a lot of sense"
"I love your package. It is sweet, simple, and to the point. However, I'm a little curious about what the package actually does. The readme file makes no sense"
"Overall this is an interesting idea for a package, and you did well on the execution. As for the error you got, it is because after the argument is passed through if condition that does not exist. I recommend redo."
Great project. Great functions and great coverge of the functions in the documention
"I am not sure about this work. The functions are not real, and I can not test them because there is no data. So, I am not sure what I am looking at."
"This is not good project. Lacks of functions, documentation and supprting files. I also did not find the data the project reported analyze."
"This package has a good idea, but it does not have the necessary documentation to explain to the user how to actually use it. Additionally, the included functions call for variables that are not used. Instead, favoring user input."
"I like this package, it has all the elements that we were asked to provide. That includes functions, data, documentation, and others."
This is a great project. It has all the elements required to have.
Great project. I did not see any documentation or testing file to show that this project went QA testing

Great functions and documentations. Well done
This is very creative project. The functions are complex and documentations provide simple way to understand the stracture of this project.
Love this project. I like the simple idea it is.
This package functioned but it didn't actually deal with any data. It feels it is empty.
"I  love your package. It is sweet, simple, and to the point. However, I'm a concern what the package actually does.I did not get the dull picture from the READ.Me file or the blog posting"
"Great project. However, the functions created for this project is not well documentated and do not provide real examples."
This is a great project. It has all the elements required to have.

I also liked the package but I was able to run it
"Great idea and great project. However, the files posted on GitHub do not provide access."
"I really like this package, the concept is quite interesting and I think that it is probably the most unique one I have seen so far!"
"Overall this is an interesting idea for a package, and you did well on the execution"
Great job.
Great
This project has all the necessary elements. Well done
" Package is not very unique. The compare function even refers to one of the functions in the package, and does nothing special that can be done with the same amount of code in base R."
Overall impression - I am not quite sure the use of these functions and I could not find a good description/example of the package in use.
"The package does not necessarily need a Data folder, however, the package is missing a Vignette which would be preferred to have. For this, I give a partial score of [0.75] because the package is self explanatory after you run the function BreakTime()."
"Overall impression: An interesting idea. I'm really interested in networks and network analysis, and this an interesting way to facilitate that. On a practical level, I had some difficulty installing the package, so I didn't get to try it out for myself, sadly."
Outstanding work. Great functions and documentations
Your project shows your creativity and your perfect code for execution. Well done
Overall impression - Very analytical and specific which could help others with sport data related R coding.
 Fairly consistent project. It holds1 giant function and contains the description file but contains no folder. I can't compile the package because it is not ready. But coding looks solid.
"Good quality analysis with a lot of moving parts, from data importing to cleaning and analyzing. While there is technically only 1 function, this function does a lot of work and could be split into at least 3 different functions. Although for the purpose of the package, it is more convenient for the user to only make 1 function call in this context. "
This works start good but in the end it is not. I am sorry to report
Outstanding work. I loved your emojis library.
This is unique and orignal package. Made me smile which is always good
"Project seems a bit unfocused. I don't really see the point of having a library of emojis. The graph does not provide any type of statistical relevance. The project clearly shows a knowledge base of how to use R on a technical level, but not a fundamental level."
"That is excellent work, well done. I am impressed with the functions you created and documentation you provided. The only thing I am missing is a folder called Data where you outline the data you employed for your functions."
I really like your squarepower.R function and provide great documentation. 
"Outstanding, excellent documentation and very creative functions. The package has all the necessary elements"
"Well done on your project. Your functions and documentation of your project are very clean and easy to follow. I was also impressed by your functions, that is very good work."
"Overall, a great project. I still recommend you reorganize your files and the names of the folders with short names together with standard names that most r packages have: R, man, Data, etc. "
Well done with great documentation.
"A great idea for the package. However, the assortments of the your files are not organized. That is a shame"
Outstanding R project. I like it
 Perfect project
This is bad. I saw only four files and they are not R files.
I do not understand this work. This is why I voted redo the project
Revamp the entire project.
Great job. 
Outstanding project
Perfect project
This is not good work. So many files are missing.
"This is something wrong with this project. Missing files, lack of documentations, lack of organization and testing. "
This is bad !!!!
"That is not project I expected to see. The project is missing major files, folders, structure etc."
This is not unique work. I have a feeling this was made last night. 
"This is not good work. I did not see the documentations, or testing files, and many others"
